# Slides for Consul Workshops
Slides for all Consul workshops should be created using [Remark](https://remarkjs.com) and placed under this directory which is organized by cloud and then by workshop.  If a workshop targets a single cloud, its slides should be placed in a directory under that cloud's directory (aws, azure, or gcp). If a workshop can be used with multiple clouds, its slides should be placed in a directory under the [multi-cloud](./multi-cloud) directory.

Please be sure to always put all slides for any workshop in its own directory.
