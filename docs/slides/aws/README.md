# Slides for Consul Workshops that Target AWS
Slides for all Consul workshops that target AWS should be created using [Remark](https://remarkjs.com) and placed under this directory.

Slides that target more than one cloud should be placed under the [multi-cloud](../multi-cloud) directory.

Please be sure to always put all slides for any workshop in its own directory.
