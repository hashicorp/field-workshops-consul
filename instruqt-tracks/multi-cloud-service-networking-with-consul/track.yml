  notes:
  - type: text
    contents: |
      You are being provisioned on-demand cloud infrastructure. <br>
      Please be patient as this can take up to ~15 minutes.
  assignment: |
    The terraform code will provision cloud infrastructure in AWS, GPC, and Azure. <br>

    Your lab environment will leverage pre-built packer images.
    You can inspect the image build in the code editor, and validate the images are available in AWS & Azure. <br>

    ```
    az image list -g packer | jq
    aws ec2 describe-images --owners self | jq
    ```

    Inspect the terraform code and validate the VPCs and VNets that were pre-provisioned for shared services and application workloads. <br>

    ```
    aws ec2 describe-vpcs
    gcloud compute networks list
    az network vnet list
    ```

    If you get an error on your Packer images, you can rebuild either image below from the packer directory:

    ```
    cd /root/packer/
    ```

    * AWS - `packer build -force -only=amazon-ebs-ubuntu-bionic hashistack.json`
    * AZURE - `packer build -force -only=azure-ubuntu-bionic hashistack.json`

    In the next few challenges we will centralize secrets across environments.

  title: Centralize Secrets in Vault
  teaser: Create trust and seed bootstrap credentials.
  assignment: |-
    In this assignment you will centralize secrets in Vault that will be consumed by applications and services across clouds and runtimes. <br>

    The Vault servers are now available and the UI can be accessed in the tab. <br>

    * AWS Vault - `ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output aws_vault_ip)`
    * Azure Vault - `ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output azure_vault_ip)`

    Check the replication status. <br>

    ```
    vault read -format=json sys/replication/status | jq
    ```

    Vault replication is configured across AWS & Azure.
    See the [documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/enterprise/replication) for more information about Vault replication. <br>

    An admin account in Vault is now available. Use the below command to log in. <br>

    ```
    vault login -method=userpass username=admin password=admin
    ```

    You can also view the [auth methods](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth) and [secrets engines](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets) that are configured for the environments.

    ```
    vault secrets list
    vault auth list
    ```

    Inspect the role bindings that are configured for the Consul server infrastructure.

    ```
    vault read /auth/aws/role/consul
    vault read /auth/azure/role/consul
    ```

    Now that the configuration is valid, seed the initial secret for Consul.

    ```
    vault kv put kv/consul \
      master_token=$(cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid) \
      gossip_key=$(consul keygen) \
      ttl=5m
    ```

    Last, configure Vault to support Auto Config in the AWS DC. Auto Config is out of scope for this lab in Azure DC.

    ```
    vault write /auth/aws/config/identity iam_alias=full_arn
    vault write identity/oidc/key/consul allowed_client_ids=consul-server-aws-us-east-1
    vault write identity/oidc/role/consul-aws-us-east-1 ttl=30m key=consul client_id=consul-server-aws-us-east-1 template='{"consul": {"node_arn": {{identity.entity.aliases.'$(vault auth list -format=json | jq -r '."aws/".accessor')'.name}} } }'
    ```

    **NOTE**: If you receive errors you can run the following two scripts to repair your Vault environment.

    ```
    /root/terraform/vault/reset_vault.sh
    /root/terraform/vault/setup_vault.sh
    vault login -method=userpass username=admin password=admin
    vault kv put kv/consul \
      master_token=$(cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid) \
      gossip_key=$(consul keygen) \
      ttl=5m
    ```

    You will tie these tokens to Consul policies in a later assignment.

  title: Provision AWS Consul Primary Datacenter
  teaser: Run Consul in AWS
  assignment: |-
    In this assignment you will bootstrap the initial cluster and validate the health of the server.
    The primary Consul server cluster resides in AWS. <br>

    Inspect the initialization scripts in the CLI or UI.

    ```
    cat scripts/aws_consul_server.sh
    cat scripts/aws_mesh_gateway.sh
    ```

    Inspect the Terraform and provision the servers.

    ```
    terraform plan
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

    You can monitor the init scripts with the below commands. <br>


    * Consul Server - `ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output aws_consul_public_ip) 'tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log'`
    * Consul MGW - `ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output aws_mgw_public_ip) 'tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log'`

    Wait for the server to elect a leader (it can take a few minutes for the EC2 instance to become available). <br>

    ```
    consul_api=$(terraform output aws_consul_public_ip)
    curl -s -v http://{$consul_api}:8500/v1/status/leader
    ```

    In the next assignment you will finish configuring the Consul primary server.

  title: Bootstrap Consul Primary Datacenter
  teaser: Set up Consul for multi-datacenter
  assignment: |-
    In this assignment you will finish configuring the primary server
    and configure tokens and policies for federated clusters to connect to the primary. <br>

    * [Vault CA](https://www.consul.io/docs/connect/ca/vault)
    * [Secure Multi DC](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/access-control-replication-multiple-datacenters)
    * [Proxy Defaults](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/config-entries/proxy-defaults)

    The Consul server is now available in the UI. <br>

    The Consul server was initialized with a [master token](https://www.consul.io/docs/security/acl/acl-system#builtin-tokens)
    to facilitate the bootstrap process. <br>

    Log in to Vault and get an admin token to finish setting up the Consul server cluster. <br>

    ```
    vault login -method=userpass username=admin password=admin
    export CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN=$(vault kv get -field master_token kv/consul)
    ```

    Vault can [create short lived tokens](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/consul) for Consul access.
    Configure that now so we can provide least privilege to operators. <br>

    ```
    AWS_CONSUL_IP=$(terraform output -state /root/terraform/aws-consul-primary/terraform.tfstate aws_consul_public_ip)
    consul acl policy create -name operator -rules @/root/policies/consul/operator.hcl
    vault secrets enable consul
    vault write consul/config/access \
        address=http://${AWS_CONSUL_IP}:8500 \
        token=$(consul acl token create -description 'vault mgmt' -policy-name=global-management -format=json | jq -r '.SecretID')
    vault write consul/roles/operator policies=operator ttl=30m
    ```

    You can now request a short lived token to make administrative changes to the cluster. <br>

    ```
    export CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN=$(vault read -field token consul/creds/operator)
    consul acl token read -self
    ```

    Add a policy for the Consul agents. <br>

    ```
    consul acl policy create -name agent -rules @/root/policies/consul/agent.hcl
    vault write consul/roles/agent policies=agent
    ```

    Add a policy for the mesh gateway so this token is dynamically managed by Vault for Consul.
    You may need to wait a minute or so for this to be picked up by the MGW process.

    ```
    consul acl policy create -name mesh-gateway -rules @/root/policies/consul/mesh-gateway.hcl
    vault write consul/roles/mgw policies=mesh-gateway
    sleep 60
    ```
    You can monitor the MGW with the below commands. <br>

    * Consul MGW - `ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output aws_mgw_public_ip) 'journalctl -u consul -f'`

    Check out the Consul Auto Config configuration on the Consul Server and an example Consul Client.  The `node_arn` will allow us to get a node identity signed by Vault.

    Start with the server. <br>

    ```
    ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output aws_consul_public_ip) 'cat /etc/consul.d/server.json' | jq .auto_config
    ```

    Check the MGW client agent config. <br>

    ```
    ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output aws_mgw_public_ip) 'cat /etc/consul.d/auto.json' | jq
    ```

    Check the MGW client agent node.

    ```
    ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output aws_mgw_public_ip) 'curl -s localhost:8500/v1/agent/self' | jq .Config.NodeName
    ```

    Now review the issued intro token and check that it was signed by Vault. The token will have a 30 min expiry.

    ```
    curl -s $VAULT_ADDR/v1/identity/oidc/.well-known/keys  | jq
    ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output aws_mgw_public_ip) 'cat /etc/consul.d/token' | jwt
    ```

    The auto config secrets will be stored in the `data_dir`. These will be auto rotated by the Consul client. <br>

    Check the ACL secrets. <br>

    ```
    ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output aws_mgw_public_ip) 'sudo cat /opt/consul/data/auto-config.json' | jq .Config.ACL
    ```

    Check the Gossip Key. <br>

    ```
    ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output aws_mgw_public_ip) 'sudo cat /opt/consul/data/auto-config.json' | jq .Config.Gossip
    ```

    Next, tie the token in Vault to the replication policy so we can establish trust with federated clusters. <br>

    ```
    consul acl policy create -name replication -rules @/root/policies/consul/replication.hcl
    vault write consul/roles/replication policies=replication
    ```

    Add an additionally policy for Vault SD for Consul.

    ```
    consul acl policy create -name vault -rules @/root/policies/consul/vault.hcl
    vault write consul/roles/vault policies=vault
    ```

    Check the CA infrastructure for the primary. Notice the `pri-` prefix for primary DC. <br>

    ```
    curl -s ${CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR}/v1/connect/ca/roots | jq '.Roots'
    curl -s ${CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR}/v1/connect/ca/roots | jq -r '.Roots[0].RootCert' | openssl x509 -text -noout
    ```

    Last, apply defaults for the service mesh that you'll leverage in the last few assignments. <br>

    ```
    consul config write proxy-defaults.hcl
    ```

    In the next few assignments you will connect secondary Consul datacenters to this cluster.

    Next, deploy the Consul servers. You can review the configuration in the code editor.

    ```
    kubectl create secret generic consul-ent-license --from-literal="key=$(cat /etc/consul.hclic)"
    helm install hashicorp hashicorp/consul -f /root/helm/gke-consul-values.yaml --debug --wait --version 0.33.0
    ```

    Check that all three clusters are federated.

    ```
    consul members -wan
    ```

    In the next assignment you will connect Consul secondary components to the server clusters in AWS & Azure.

    ```
    consul acl policy create -name consul-esm -rules @/root/policies/consul/consul-esm.hcl
    vault write consul/roles/esm policies=consul-esm
    ```

    Inspect the Terraform code and provision the external monitoring.

    ```
    terraform plan
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

    You can monitor the init scripts with the below commands. <br>
    * AWS ESM - `ssh ubuntu@$(terraform output aws_esm_public_ip) 'tail -f /var/log/cloud-init-output.log'`

    In this assignment you will validate the product DB and access to the payment queue. <br>

    Check the DB for available products. <br>

    ```
    export PGPASSWORD=$(terraform output -state /root/terraform/database-services/terraform.tfstate postgres_password)
    psql -U postgres@$(terraform output -state /root/terraform/infra/terraform.tfstate env) \
      -d postgres \
      -h $(terraform output -state /root/terraform/database-services/terraform.tfstate postgres_fqdn) \
      -c 'SELECT * FROM coffees' \
      -a
    ```

    Check the queue for payments (there will be zero keys). <br>

    ```
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@$(terraform output -state /root/terraform/infra/terraform.tfstate aws_bastion_ip) \
      "redis-cli -h \
      $(terraform output -state /root/terraform/cache-services/terraform.tfstate -json aws_elasticache_cache_nodes | jq -r .[0].address) -p 6379 keys '*'"
    ```

    In the next few assignments you will retrieve products and send payments.

  title: Test Application Deployment
  teaser: Put it all together
  assignment: |-
    In this assignment you will test the application. <br>

    The UI is available on the react cluster. <br>

    ```
    kubectl config use-context react
    echo "http://$(kubectl get svc nginx-ingress-controller -o json | jq -r .status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip)"
    ```

    Monitor the cache for incoming payments in one window. <br>

    ```
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@$(terraform output -state /root/terraform/infra/terraform.tfstate aws_bastion_ip) \
      "redis-cli -h \
      $(terraform output -state /root/terraform/cache-services/terraform.tfstate -json aws_elasticache_cache_nodes | jq -r .[0].address) -p 6379 MONITOR"
    ```

    In the other window send traffic to the HashiCups public APIs. <br>

    ```
    kubectl config use-context graphql
    endpoint=$(kubectl get svc consul-graphql-graphql-ingress-gateway -o json | jq -r .status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip)
    ```

    Try the Product API. <br>

    ```
    curl -s -v http://${endpoint}:8080/api \
      -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -H 'Accept: application/json' \
      -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \
      -H 'DNT: 1' \
      --data-binary '{"query":"{\n  coffees{id,name,price}\n}"}' \
      --compressed | jq
    ```

    Try the payment API. <br>

    #payments

    ```
    curl -s -v http://${endpoint}:8080/api \
      -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
