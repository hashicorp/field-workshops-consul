  assignment: |-
    In this assignment, take a few moments to review the lab and the overall architecture for HashiCups.
    You can see the repository for the HashiCups demo application here: https://github.com/hashicorp-demoapp. <br>


    You can also view the services already running in your primary Kube cluster. Prometheus will deploy in a future assignment. <br>

    Check the first k8s cluster. <br>

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s1
    kubectl get deployments
    kubectl get pods
    kubectl get svc
    ```

    Check the second k8s cluster. <br>

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s2
    kubectl get deployments
    kubectl get pods
    kubectl get svc
    ```

    In the next few assignments you will validate the Consul deployment.

    You can see the complete guide on Kubernetes multi-cluster federation here: https://www.consul.io/docs/k8s/installation/multi-cluster/kubernetes <br>

    Start validating Consul on k8s1 with Helm. This cluster that will run our stateless workloads.  <br>

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s1
    helm status consul
    ```

    Check the pods. <br>

    ```
    kubectl get pods -l app=consul
    ```

    Check the Consul API. <br>

    ```
    curl localhost:8500/v1/status/leader
    ```

    You can also see the Consul UI is now up. <br>

    Last, set up the proxy, and mesh defaults for the mesh. <br>

    Review the configuration. <br>

    ```
    cat deployments/config/proxy-defaults.yml

  assignment: |-
    Your application should now be available. You can quickly test the APIs by exposing the public API as a NodePort services.
    NodePort services are uncommon in production, but suitable for dev and test. <br>

    First, let's look at the differences for upstream services located in the same k8s1 cluster, and services in a different cluster. <br>

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s1
    ```

    Same cluster: Public API <br>
    The address will be for a sidecar pod. <br>

    ```
    kubectl exec deploy/public-api -c envoy-sidecar -- wget -qO- 127.0.0.1:19000/clusters | grep product
    ```

    External cluster: Payments API <br>
    The address will be for the local mesh gateway running in the cluster. <br>

    ```
    kubectl exec deploy/payments-api-v1 -c envoy-sidecar -- wget -qO- 127.0.0.1:19000/clusters | grep payments-queue
    ```

    The gateway will inspect the SNI headers and forward it along to the correct destination.
    Inspect the SNI value for this service now. <br>

    ```
    kubectl exec deploy/payments-api-v1 -c envoy-sidecar -- wget -qO- 127.0.0.1:19000/config_dump | jq '[.. |."dynamic_active_clusters"? | select(. != null)[1]]'
    ```

    Now that you understand the internals of the cross cluster routing, let's test the application so you can make sure it works. <br>

    ```
    kubectl describe svc consul-ingress-gateway
    ip=$(kubectl get svc consul-ingress-gateway -o json | jq -r '.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip')
    ```

    Try the product API. <br>

    ```
    curl -s -v http://${ip}:8080/api \
    -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \
    -H 'DNT: 1' \
    --data-binary '{"query":"{\n  coffees{id,name,price}\n}"}' \
    --compressed | jq
    ```

    Try the payment API. <br>

    ```
    curl -s -v http://${ip}:8080/api \
    -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \
    -H 'DNT: 1' \
    --data-binary '{"query":"mutation{ pay(details:{ name: \"nic\", type: \"mastercard\", number: \"1234123-0123123\", expiry:\"10/02\", cv2: 1231, amount: 12.23 }){id, card_plaintext, card_ciphertext, message } }"}' \
    --compressed | jq
    ```

    You should have received a 200 status code from the app API.  <br>

    Optionally, you can review the data directly in the storage tier.
    There will be at least one payment in the queue after running the above APIs.

    Switch to the other K8s cluster. <br>

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s2
    ```

    Check the payment queue. <br>

    ```
    kubectl exec statefulset/payments-queue -- redis-cli KEYS '*'
    ```

    Check the database. <br>

    ```
    kubectl exec statefulset/product-db -- env PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -U postgres -d products -c 'SELECT * FROM coffees' -a
    ```

    In the next few assignments you will be introduced to more advanced traffic management patterns.

  title: 'Service Mesh: Service Discovery'
  teaser: Scale up & Scale Down
  assignment: |
    Service Discovery is a important component of Service Mesh, and K8s is one of many platforms Consul supports native service discovery.
    Understanding of the low level data plane is not required, but it can be helpful to get a deeper understanding of the mesh at work!

    When running on K8s, Consul can consume K8s probes to determine if an instance is healthy or not to receive traffic.
    You will test this workflow below. <br>

    Before you start, let's add curl to the container. <br>

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s1
    kubectl exec deploy/payments-api-v1 -c payments-api -- apk add curl
    ```

    First let's look at the health check for our payments API. It will return a 200. <br>

    ```
    kubectl exec deploy/payments-api-v1 -c payments-api -- curl -s 127.0.0.1:8080/actuator/health | jq
    ```

    Check the dataplane for this instance of the payments api. You will inspect the Public API that connects to this service.

    ```
    kubectl exec deploy/public-api -c envoy-sidecar -- wget -qO- 127.0.0.1:19000/clusters | grep payments-api
    ```

    You will simulate an issue with the Redis component and see how this change is propagated through the mesh.
    Scale the Redis component to zero on the stateless cluster.
    You will wait 15 seconds for the three consecutive health checks to fail in the probe. <br>


    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s2
    kubectl scale statefulset payments-queue --replicas=0
    sleep 30
    ```

    Return to the other K8s cluster and check the health check again.
    The status will be DOWN, with the REDIS component showing refused connection. <br>

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s1
    kubectl exec deploy/payments-api-v1 -c payments-api -- curl -s 127.0.0.1:8080/actuator/health | jq
    ```

    Let's check the status off the probe. <br>

    ```
    kubectl get pod --selector=app=payments-api,version=v1 -o json | jq .items[0].status.conditions
    ```

    Now, Check the status in Consul. <br>

    ```
    curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/health/checks/payments-api | jq
    ```

    This will remove this instance from the data plane. You will see this reflected in Envoy's health flag.
    The data plane keeps track of how many in total nodes there (healthy vs unhealthy) so it has an understadning of the proportion between the two.
    The flag will prevent this instance from receiving traffic, and the value will be `/failed_eds_health` <br>

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s1
    kubectl exec deploy/public-api -c envoy-sidecar -- wget -qO- 127.0.0.1:19000/clusters | grep payments-api
    ```

    Let's bring the queue services back, and add an additional instance of our payment service.

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s2
    kubectl scale statefulset payments-queue --replicas=1
    sleep 30
    ```

    Check the health check again for the payments API.

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s1
    kubectl exec deploy/payments-api-v1 -c payments-api -- curl -s 127.0.0.1:8080/actuator/health | jq
    ```

    Check the probe again. <br>

    ```
    kubectl get pod --selector=app=payments-api,version=v1 -o json | jq .items[0].status.conditions
    ```

    Now, check the health check again in Consul.
    The status will be passing. <br>

    ```
    curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/health/checks/payments-api | jq
    ```

    The dataplane will be updated to reflect this change.
    The `health_flags` will be `healthy`. <br>

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s1
    kubectl exec deploy/public-api -c envoy-sidecar -- wget -qO- 127.0.0.1:19000/clusters | grep payments-api
    ```

    Last, let's add an additional instance of the payments API and see how quickly our public API propagates that update. <br>

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s1
    kubectl scale deployment.v1.apps/payments-api-v1 --replicas=2
    sleep 30
    ```

    Check that the Consul control plane has this change, and that it gets to our dataplane.
    Flags for these services are set to `healthy`. <br>

    ```
    curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8500/v1/catalog/service/payments-api | jq '[.. |."ServiceAddress"? | select(. != null)]'
    kubectl exec deploy/public-api -c public-api -- wget -qO- 127.0.0.1:19000/clusters | grep payments-api
    ```

    kubectl exec deploy/public-api -c envoy-sidecar -- wget -qO- 127.0.0.1:19000/clusters
    kubectl exec deploy/public-api -c envoy-sidecar -- wget -qO- 127.0.0.1:19000/config_dump | jq '[.. |."routes"? | select(. != null)][-1]'
    ```

    Query the payment API a few times.
    You will see a mix of unencrypted and encrypted records. <br>


    Get the endpoint. <br>

    ```
    kubectl describe svc consul-ingress-gateway
    ip=$(kubectl get svc consul-ingress-gateway -o json | jq -r '.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip')
    ```

    Try the API. Run the command a few times to see the difference in the encrypted and non-encrypted values. <br>

    ```
    curl -s -v http://${ip}:8080/api \
    -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \
    -H 'DNT: 1' \
    --data-binary '{"query":"mutation{ pay(details:{ name: \"nic\", type: \"mastercard\", number: \"1234123-0123123\", expiry:\"10/02\", cv2: 1231, amount: 12.23 }){id, card_plaintext, card_ciphertext, message } }"}' \
    --compressed | jq
    ```

    If you are getting 200 responses, you can cut over the rest of the traffic to the encrypted solution. <br>

    ```
    cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
    apiVersion: consul.hashicorp.com/v1alpha1
    kind: ServiceSplitter
    metadata:
      name: payments-api
    spec:
      splits:
        - weight: 0
          serviceSubset: v1
        - weight: 100
          serviceSubset: v2
    EOF
    ```

    Check that the v2 service is now 100% weighted. <br>

    ```
    kubectl exec deploy/public-api -c envoy-sidecar -- wget -qO- 127.0.0.1:19000/config_dump | jq '[.. |."routes"? | select(. != null)][-1]'
    ```

    Now that each record will be encrypted, validate in the redis cache that the value in the queue is indeed ciphertexts.

    ```
    kubectl config use-context k8s1
    id=$(curl -s http://${ip}:8080/api -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'DNT: 1' --data-binary '{"query":"mutation{ pay(details:{ name: \"nic\", type: \"mastercard\", number: \"1234123-0123123\", expiry:\"10/02\", cv2: 1231, amount: 12.23 }){id, card_plaintext, card_ciphertext, message } }"}' --compressed | jq  -r .data.pay.id)
    kubectl config use-context k8s2
    kubectl exec statefulset/payments-queue -- redis-cli HGET "payment:${id}" "cc.number"
    ```

    You will collect some metrics and traces from the new application in the new few exercises.

  assignment: |-
    In this assignment you will run a traffic simulation to create metrics to visualize on the Consul dashboard. <br>

    Check that Prometheus is deployed.

    ```
    kubectl get pods --selector app=prometheus
    kubectl get svc --selector app=prometheus
    ```

    Redeploy the v2 application with chaos monkey enabled so we can create some errors and latency in the payments tier.
    You can scale the v1 deployment at this time as they are no longer needed. <br>

    ```
    kubectl scale deployment.v1.apps/payments-api-v1 --replicas=0
    kubectl apply -f observability/payments-api-v2-chaos.yml
    sleep 10
    kubectl wait pod --for=condition=Ready --selector=app=payments-api,version=v2,chaos=latency --timeout=90s
    kubectl wait pod --for=condition=Ready --selector=app=payments-api,version=v2,chaos=exception --timeout=90s
    ```

    Apply the traffic simulator and observe the dashboards in the Consul UI. <br>

    ```
    kubectl apply -f observability/traffic.yml
    ```

    Wait a few moments and observe the traffic on the Consul dashboard.

    Additionally, you can deploy the Grafana dashboards below to monitor the health of the consul system, as well as your workloads.
    To create the sample dashboard select the `+` in the left side navigation to `Import`. <br>

    In the next assignment you will look at traces for this traffic.

  teaser: Apply Layer 4 Intentions
  assignment: |-
    Intentions are deny by default in a secure configuration.
    Test that in this challenge. <br>

    Check the rbac filter. <br>

    ```
    kubectl exec deploy/public-api -c envoy-sidecar -- wget -qO- 127.0.0.1:19000/config_dump | jq '[.. |."http_filters"? | select(. != null)[0]]'
    ```

    Clear the intentions for the app.

    ```
    kubectl delete -f v1/service-intentions.yml
    ```

    Check the rbac filter. <br>

    ```
    kubectl exec deploy/public-api -c envoy-sidecar -- wget -qO- 127.0.0.1:19000/config_dump | jq '[.. |."http_filters"? | select(. != null)[0]]'
    ```

    Get the gateway IP. <br>

    ```
    kubectl describe svc consul-ingress-gateway
    ip=$(kubectl get svc consul-ingress-gateway -o json | jq -r '.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip')
    ```

    Send the payment API. <br>

    ```
    curl -s -v http://${ip}:8080/api \
    -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \

    --compressed | jq
    ```

    You will see an error. <br>

    Add the intentions back <br>

    ```
    kubectl apply -f v1/service-intentions.yml
    ```

    Check the filter.

    Try the API again to fix the connectivity. You will need to wait a few moments for the change to propagate. <br>
