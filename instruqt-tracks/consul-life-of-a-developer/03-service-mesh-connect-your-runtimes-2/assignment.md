In this assignment you will validate the steps in this guide for the secondary cluster: https://www.consul.io/docs/k8s/installation/multi-cluster/kubernetes <br>

Deploy Consul to k8s2 cluster.

```
kubectl config use-context k8s2
helm status consul
```

Check the pods. <br>

```
kubectl get pods -l app=consul
```

Check that the Kubernetes clusters are now federated.

```
consul members -wan
```

In this new few assignments, you will deploy workloads to these clusters.
