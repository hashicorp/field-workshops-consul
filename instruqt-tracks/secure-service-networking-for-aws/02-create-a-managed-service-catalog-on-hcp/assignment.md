We're going to use terraform to deploy both HCP Consul and HCP Vault. To do this, first we need to create an HCP account from which we can provision services.

In this section you will use terraform to provision an HCP Consul cluster peered to your Instruqt AWS account.

When you are ready to provision the resources, in the `shell` tab, execute:

```sh
nohup terraform apply -auto-approve > /root/terraform/tf-deploy-hcp-consul/hcp.out &
```

NOTE: we run this in the background (`nohup` / `&`) so that it continues even if your communication with the Instruqt platform is interrupted.

The HPC Consul deployment takes a few minutes to create the resources: consul cluster, vpcs, peering, routes, etc.

You can monitor the progress of the deployment using the following command:

```sh
tail -f /root/terraform/tf-deploy-hcp-consul/hcp.out
```

While thats running, lets take a look at what we're building in the `code - HCP` tab.

HCP Consul generates the cregistration file requires for connecting consul agents to the HCP Consul cluster. To read the consul config file, execute the following command:

```sh
terraform output -raw hcp_consul_config_file | base64 -d | jq
```

Save some of the HCP output for later reference with the following commands:
===


First we shall grab the consul agent configuration file generated by HCP:
```sh
terraform output -raw hcp_consul_config_file | base64 -d | jq > /root/config/hcp_client_config.json
```

Now we shall grab the HCP Consul CA for our EKS deployments:
```sh
terraform output -raw hcp_consul_ca_file | base64 -d > /root/config/hcp_ca.pem
```

Review the output in the `code - HCP Config` tab.
