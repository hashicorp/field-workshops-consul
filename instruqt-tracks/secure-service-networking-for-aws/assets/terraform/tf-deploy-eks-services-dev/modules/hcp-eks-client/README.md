## hcp-eks-client

A Terraform module used to install the Consul Helm chart onto a Kubernetes
cluster.

This module is intended for demonstration purposes only at the moment.  While
the Consul clients will be deployed secure-by-default, the limited configuration
options presented by the module are to aid a user in quickly getting started.
