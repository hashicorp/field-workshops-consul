In the last assignment we created an Envoy listener for our database
service through a Connect upstream definition. <br>

Let's use that definition to allow our application to connect to the database. <br>

On line 32 of the `App Config` tab, recall our listener is configured on localhost, so we can just update our address to `127.0.0.1`, and establish connectivity. <br>

Go ahead and do this now. Check the `Website` tab.
