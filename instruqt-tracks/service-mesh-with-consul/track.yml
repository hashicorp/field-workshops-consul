title: Service Mesh with Consul
teaser: Evolve from service discovery to service mesh. No more mapping IP addresses
  and ports across load balancers and firewalls. Consul Connect ensures secure connections
  between services wherever they run.
description: |-
  This track will build on what you learned in the service discovery track and take our application from service discovery to service mesh.
  We'll dive into mesh fundamentals and use an Envoy proxy to connect our application to its database.
