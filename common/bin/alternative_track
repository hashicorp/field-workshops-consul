# NOTE: So, `yq` likes to `prettify` output if you use its
#       `-i` option to update a file in-place, which causes
#       excessivly complicated diffs to review. So we use
#       `yq` to query things out of yaml files, but edit
#       with things like sed or awk

# Our standard process for creating test or alternative versions
# of a track:
#
# 1. Change title to start with "WIP $(jira ticket number) - "
# 2. Change track slug to start with "wip-$(jira ticket number)-"
# 3. Remove 'id:' field from 'track.yml' and all 'assignment.md' files
# 4. Remove 'checksum:' field from 'track.yml'
# 
# This allows us to easily identify alternative versions of a track
# by both the name and slug, keeps the "production" version of the track 
# easily identifiable, and does the right thing with the 'id' and
# 'checksum' fields so Instruqt doesn't get confused. Having things start
# with 'WIP' or 'wip' also tends to push them later in the listing.
#
# You must supply a JIRA ticket number, it's our standard system for
# recording work progress and history, so it's the best identifier for
# the job.
#
# Steps 3 and 4 are handled by `clean_id_and_checksums` in the standard
# track Makefile

# Assumes being ran from make, in a track directory
