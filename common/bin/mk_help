Available commands:

* \`make jira=<jira-ticket-number> alternate_track\`

  In the directory for a given track, do the right thing to prepare
  the track to be a alternate version: remove track and challenge IDs,
  and track checksum, so Instruqt doesn't get confused, and change the
  track title and slug so it is easy to distinguish it from production
  versions of tracks.

  Running this command and then performing an \`instruqt track push\`
  should Just Do The Right Thing(TM)


* \`make clean_id_and_checksums\`

  In the directory for a given track, remove track and challenge IDs
  and track checksum. Useful for tidying before creating a PR to merge
  changes back in. Automatically done by \`alternate_track\`
