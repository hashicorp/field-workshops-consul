# 'id:' to all of your 'assignment.md' files, which it appears
# to use internally to associate things. If you attempt to make
# a test or alternate version of a track and leave these in,
# Instruqt can get confused, ranging from complaining at you to
# overwriting parts of the original track. But you can safely
# delete these lines from those files, which is how we get around
# this in general
